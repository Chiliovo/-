### Zhou Gong Dream Interpretation
<details>
<summary>Zhou Gong Dream Interpretation</summary>

> There is a Chinese saying: "Officials ask about punishments, the rich ask about disasters, and common people ask about fortune."

> No matter whether you are rich or poor, whether you are an official or a commoner, you cannot avoid the seven disasters and eight hardships.

> Dreams are a psychological activity during sleep; they are neither divine revelations nor out-of-body experiences unrelated to the person. Therefore, only through scientific analysis of dreams can the link between dreams and real life be revealed.

## Bazi Quick Divination
<details>
<summary>Bazi Quick Divination</summary>

> In this world, there is no absolute distinction between good and bad people, only those who can enhance one's energy and those who deplete it.

> A person's behavioral patterns can be represented by the Four Pillars (Bazi) model, which means that specific time, space, characters, and actions together determine the final result.

> At the moment of an individual's birth, the energy of the terrestrial magnetic field is infused into their body, thereby influencing their life trajectory to some extent. This is what is meant by fate.
